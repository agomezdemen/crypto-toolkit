# Crypto Toolkit (Rust) – Educational (In Progress)

**This project is for learning and demonstration purposes. Do not use in production.**

## Overview

A Rust-based cryptography library and CLI I am actively developing to deepen my understanding of security fundamentals. The toolkit is designed for educational exploration of cryptographic algorithms and their practical implementation.

## Current Progress (v0.1 – Development Stage)

- Utilities: Number theory helpers (e.g., gcd, egcd) for cryptographic math.

- RSA: In progress (key generation, OAEP, PSS under development).

## Planned Features

- AES-256-GCM (AEAD)

- SHA-256 / BLAKE3

- PEM import/export

- CLI with clap

- Test coverage, benchmarking, and GitHub Actions CI
